// time complexity QUANTIFIES the amount of time taken by a program to run as a function of length of the input
// space complexity QUANTIFIES the amount of time taken by a program to run as a function of length of the input. Directly proportional to the largest memory the program acquires at any instance of time
// a good program must take less time and take less space to be more efficient

// types of time complexities :
// 1. Worst Case : O
// 2. Best Case : Omega
// 3. Average Case : Big Theta


// in a linear search (example): 20, 10, 5, 100, 300, 17, 238
// x = 20   -> best case, omega
// x = 238  -> worst case, big oh
// x = anything else -> average case, big theta

// best case is usually proportional to a constant
// worst case is proportional to n
// average case is also proportional to n
